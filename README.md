# Chili-Taco

Overview
In this app, I created a taco tracker with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I used Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.

- Chili Taco! is a food-truck app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat - include fields for shell type and whether its a vegetarian taco or not.

- Whenever a user submits a taco, the app will display the taco on the left side of the page -- waiting to be picked up.

- Each taco in the waiting area also has a Pick Up! button. When the user clicks it, the taco will move to the right side of the page.

- my app will store every taco in a database, whether it has been picked up or not.
